Whether people are masters of country is true yardstick, he says at meeting

President Xi Jinping has underlined further promoting whole-process democracy that enables the Chinese people to be broadly involved in national governance, saying that whether a country is democratic or not depends on whether it is truly run by the people.

Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark while addressing a central conference on work related to people's congresses, which was held from Wednesday to Thursday in Beijing.

He called for upholding and improving the system of people's congresses, a political system fundamental to the Party's leadership, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance. He said that such a system ensures the realization of whole-process democracy in the country.

In China's political system, the people exercise State power through the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, and local people's congresses at different levels, ensuring their interests are reflected in the decision-making process.

Xi called Chinese democracy "whole-process people's democracy" for the first time in November 2019 during an inspection tour of Shanghai. This enables the Chinese people to broadly and continuously participate in day-to-day political activities, including democratic elections, political consultation, decision-making and oversight.

"Democracy, a shared value of humanity, is a key tenet unswervingly upheld by the CPC and the Chinese people," Xi emphasized.

Democracy is not an ornament to be used for decoration, it is to be used to solve the problems that the people want to solve, he said.

The key to a country's democracy lies in whether the people run the country, depending on if the people have the right to vote and more importantly, whether the people have the right to broad participation, he said.
